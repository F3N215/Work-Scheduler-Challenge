## Project Summary 📋
* Using some basic starter code, I was tasked to create a simple calendar application that lets a user save events for each hour of a typical work day
* The browser app was to feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS using jQuery and Day.js library to handle dates and times
* When inputs are made and the saved button is clicked, the application stores information in local browser storage that persists on refresh
* Hours are colour-coded to past, present, future accordingly
-----
# Initial Work & Study 💻  
* Searched through previous classes and online tutorials on functions, Day.js integration and jQuery
* Goal: to understand integration of third-party APIs and how it is properly called using JS

# Collaboration Workflow 🦾
* Reviewed some of my work with my mentor which helped finalized the flow of my JS logic  * Multiple requests for information & details from Xpert Learning Assistant 
* Completed tutoring session requesting additional explanations and assistance regarding memory persistence issue and conditional formatting 
-----
## Summary of Changes 📝
 * Starting with updates to the HTML to align for time blocks, I switched over to JavaScript to start addressing logic
* Worked through developing the trackHours function to pull # of hours and update the HTML class using day.js 
* Slowly worked through logic to pull the element id and show only the hour 
* Worked out ‘if, else if’ statements to replace time block element ids with past, present or future
* Cleaned up HTML to allow for dynamic changes * Changed font styles using Google Fonts, and updated save button stylings to give them more of a “punch down” effect
* Added media queries for correct sizing on mobile * Tested ‘sunrise’ colour pallet for gradient and changed to background image instead
